              Hello! I'm a dedicated and enthusiastic developer with a
              Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications. My journey in
              technology has been driven by a deep passion for building
              beautiful, functional, and user-centric web applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              I thrive on solving complex problems and continuously learning
              new technologies. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring
              new hiking trails, reading a good book, or experimenting with new
              recipes in the kitchen.
            </p>
